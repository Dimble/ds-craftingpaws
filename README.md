Crafting Paws, a mod for Don't Starve
(based on Relaxed Crafting by noobler and Crafting Pause by hmaarrfk)

Like the horrible name suggests, this mod pauses the game when one of the two crafting bars are open or when an item is being placed.  Pausing can be individually toggled for each bar and for placement, either by an options screen or an icon bar.

The paw icon (by default just above the map controls on the bottom right) uncollapses when moused over, showing its three toggle buttons with vaguely useful icons.  Right-clicking on the paw icon changes the bar's orientation. Selecting the paw icon with the 'stack modifier' allows the bar to be moved.  After being left alone for 5 seconds the bar gets lonely and auto-collapses.

The options screen can be opened by either clicking the paws icon (currently pointless) or by a key after uncommenting it at the end of modmain.lua.

This is an early release.  It "works for me" under Shipwrecked, and seems to work in vanilla and RoG, but has not been tested by others.

  - The state of the options/bar position/etc is not saved. (yet?)
  - Controller-specific coding is missing. (I don't have one, so...)
  - The key to open the options should be configurable somehow.
  - currently lacking a few options, namely icon size and ability to skip placement pausing for some items, and that one thing you want it to do
  - Any other stuff that Don't Work

Permission is granted for any Don't Starve modders to use this as they will, as who knows if I will continue to work on it...
